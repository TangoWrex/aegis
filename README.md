Aegis is open-source software for managing IoT devices. It uses HaLow Wi-Fi for communication and runs on Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and scaling. Written in Python with a RESTful API, the central server collects data from endpoints with software-defined radios and wireless Alfa cards. Encryption secures all data.
